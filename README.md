# Email-Extractor
An email extractor or harvester is a type of software used to extract  email addresses from online and offline sources which generates a large  list of addresses. Even though these extractors can serve multiple  legitimate purposes such as marketing campaigns, unfortunately, they are  mainly used to send spamming and phishing emails.
